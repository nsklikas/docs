The OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant -also known as Device Flow- is OAuth 2.0 extension that enables devices with no browser
or limited input capability to obtain an access token. It enables users to authotize devices with limited input capabilities, such
as smart TVs, gaming consoles, or IoT devices, by delegating the authentication process to another device with a full browser such
as a phone or computer.

This document provides an overview of the Device Authorization Grant, a step-by-step example of its implementation, configuration
options, and guidance on creating custom user interfaces for the verification screen.

## Overview of the flow

Here is the high-level overview for the Device Authorization Flow:

1. The device requests to be authorized from the Authorization Server.
1. The user is instructed to visit a URL on a different device and is given a user code.
1. On a different device the user visits the URL, provides the user code, logs in and grants access to the device.
1. The device polls the Authorization Server. Once the user authenticates and grants access, an access token is returned that can
   be used to access the protected resource.

### Device requests authorization

The user tries to log in through the limited input device. The device sends a POST request to the Authorization Server to initiate
the flow with the following parameters:

- `client_id`: The ID of the client that's making the request.
- `scope` (optional): The scope of the access request, which specifies what resources the requesting application can access.

The Authorization Server responds with the following information:

- `device_code`: A unique code to identify the authorization request.
- `user_code`: A code the user will enter at the verification URL.
- `verification_uri`: The URL where the user can authorize the device.
- `verification_uri_complete`: The URL where the user can authorize the device, with the user_code already filled in.
- `expires_in`: The lifespan of the device code (in seconds).
- `interval`: The polling interval (in seconds) for the client to check if the user has authorized the device.

### Display user code and verification URI

The device shows the user the `user_code` and `verification_uri` it received from the Authorization Server.

The user visits the provided URI on a separate device, such as a phone, and enters the code.

### User grants permission

Once the user enters the code, they're prompted to log in, if not already authenticated, and grant or deny permission to the
client. After granting permission, the user is redirected to a page confirming successful login.

### Device polls for the access token

While the user is authorizing the device, the device polls the `token` endpoint of the Authorization Server to check whether the
user has completed the authorization process, by making a POST request with the following parameters:

- `client_id`: The ID of the client that's making the request.
- `device_code`: The device code received from the device authorization request.
- `grant_type`: This should always be `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code`.

After the user grants permission, the Authorization Server will respond with an access token.

## Configuration options

### Configuring the user interface

To enable and configure the Device Authorization Grant in Ory Hydra, adjust the following settings in your configuration file:

```
urls:
  device:
    verification: http://path/to/device/verification/ui
    success: http://path/to/device/success
```

### Configuring user code entropy

Depending on your security needs and your traffic load, you may wish to enhance your `user_code` entropy. The Ory Hydra
`oauth2.device_authorization.user_code_entropy` configuration supports 3 values:

- `high`: `user_code` is 8 characters long and consists of alphanumeric characters, excluding some ambiguous symbols
- `medium`: `user_code` is 8 characters long and consists of upper case letter
- `low`: `user_code` is 9 characters long and consists of numbers

Keep in mind that higher entropy may make it harder for the user to enter the user code.

## Device verification user interface implementation

Here is a sample implementation for a device verification UI :

```js
import { Configuration, OAuth2Api } from "@ory/client"
import { Request, Response } from "express"

const ory = new OAuth2Api(
  new Configuration({
    basePath: `https://${process.env.ORY_PROJECT_SLUG}.projects.oryapis.com`,
    accessToken: process.env.ORY_API_KEY,
  }),
)

// Please note that this is an example implementation.
// In a production app, please add proper error handling.
export async function handleLogin(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const challenge = request.query.device_challenge.toString()
  const userCode = request.query.user_code.toString()

  // Show the login form if the form was not submitted.
  if (request.method === "GET") {
    response.render("device", {
      challenge,
      userCode,
    })
    return
  }

  // User was authenticated successfully,
  return await ory
    .acceptUserCodeRequest({
      deviceChallenge: challenge,
      acceptDeviceUserCodeRequest: {
        user_code: userCode,
      },
    })
    .then(({ redirect_to }) => {
      response.redirect(String(redirect_to))
    })
}
```
